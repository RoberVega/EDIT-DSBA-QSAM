    "In this project we will explore a dataset with the following columns:\n",
    "- **RowNumber**—corresponds to the record number.\n",
    "- **CustomerId**—contains the identification number of the client.\n",
    "- **Surname**—the surname of the customer.\n",
    "- **CreditScore**—can have an effect on customer churn, since a customer with a higher credit score is less likely to \n",
    "leave the bank.\n",
    "- **Geography**—the customer’s location.\n",
    "- **Gender**—the customer's gender.\n",
    "- **Age**—this is certainly relevant, since older customers are less likely to leave their bank than younger ones.\n",
    "- **Tenure**—refers to the number of years that the customer has been a client of the bank. Normally, older clients are more loyal and less likely to leave a bank.\n",
    "- **Balance**—also a very good indicator of customer churn, as people with a higher balance in their accounts are less likely to leave the bank compared to those with lower balances.\n",
    "- **NumOfProducts**—refers to the number of products that a customer has purchased through the bank.\n",
    "- **HasCrCard**—denotes whether or not a customer has a credit card. This column is also relevant, since people with a credit card are less likely to leave the bank.\n",
    "- **IsActiveMember**—active customers are less likely to leave the bank.\n",
    "- **EstimatedSalary**—as with balance, people with lower salaries are more likely to leave the bank compared to those with higher salaries.\n",
    "- **Exited**—whether or not the customer left the bank.\n",
    "- **Complain**—customer has complaint or not.\n",
    "- **Satisfaction Score**—Score provided by the customer for their complaint resolution.\n",
    "- **Card Type**—type of card hold by the customer.\n",
    "- **Points Earned**—the points earned by the customer for using credit card.\n"
