# Advanced Methods in A/B Testing ðŸŒŒðŸš€

Diving deeper into the realm of A/B testing, we encounter methods that go beyond the basics.

To begin, we have Bayesian statistics, which is a shift from traditional frequentist methods. Rather than relying on p-values alone, Bayesian methods provide a probability distribution, allowing us to interpret results with more context. 

Then, we will discuss multi-armed bandits. Instead of the traditional split-testing, this dynamic approach adjusts the traffic allocation to different variants in real-time based on their performance. 

Finally, we touch upon sequential testing. This method breaks away from the shackles of fixed sample sizes, allowing tests to conclude as soon as significant results are found.

In summary, while foundational A/B test methods provide a strong base, these advanced methods offer faster results, enabling precise, flexible, and more efficient analyses.
