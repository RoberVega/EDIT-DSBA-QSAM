# Statistical Foundations for A/B Testing ðŸ“Š

As we mentioned in the introduction, statistics will play a central role in analysing our results, but proper statistics are not easy to mantain, one has to be rigorous and apply best practices. Fortunately for us, Python contains a plethora of methods to deal with the most annoying parts of doing Statistics, so it will provide us with the opportunity to focus on design and proper analysis. This is just an introductory module to basic statistics in Python. If you are already familiar with all this terms feel free to skip it, although you might miss some cool explanations.

In this module you will learn about

- [Basics of hypothesis testing](01_hypothesis_testing.md)
- [Understanding p-values, confidence intervals, and significance using `scipy.stats`](02_basic_statistical_concepts.md)
- [Errors: Type I and Type II](03_error_types.md)
- [Statistical tests](04_statistical_tests.ipynb)
