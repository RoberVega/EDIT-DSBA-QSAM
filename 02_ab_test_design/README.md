# Designing an A/B Test ðŸ§©ðŸ§©

The first step towards the designing of an A/B testing is determining sample size. Selecting the right number of participants to ensure that the test results are both statistically significant and practically relevant. 

Once this is settled, one needs to ensure that the samples are properly randomised, safeguarding the test's fairness. If not done properly, one could accidentally introduce biases on the tests, demeaning the validity of the results. 

Lastly, one has to address external factors one cannot control, being seasonality a common example. One has to consider these issues beforehand an prepare for them: these can skew results, from inherent biases in the sampling process to uncontrollable external influences.
